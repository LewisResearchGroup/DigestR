\description{
The `fo` function is responsible for loading one or more spectrum files, processing them, 
and integrating them into the `digestR` environment. If the user does not specify a 
filename, a GUI-based file selector will be triggered. The function will then read the 
specified files, verify their format and content, and make necessary updates to the global 
state. This function also provides error handling, ensuring that files with unsupported or 
corrupted formats do not crash the application.
}
\examples{
# Load a single spectrum file (assumes valid path and format)
fo("path_to_spectrum_file.txt")

# Trigger GUI-based file selector for user to select files
fo()
